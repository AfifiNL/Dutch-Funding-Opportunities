  - name: Guide AI with Project Context Files
    description: |
      IMPORTANT: To ensure consistency, prevent duplication, and track progress,
      reference relevant context files from `.cursor/rules/` in your request using '@'.
      Key files:
      - @.cursor/rules/architecture-understanding.mdc (Overall structure)
      - @.cursor/rules/plan.mdc (Current development plan)
      - @.cursor/rules/directory-structure.mdc (File organization)
      - @.cursor/rules/implement.mdc (Implementation details/notes)
      - @.cursor/rules/memory.mdc (Long-term project memory/decisions)
      - @.cursor/rules/lessons-learned.mdc (Past issues/solutions)
      - @.cursor/rules/error-documentation.mdc (Common errors)
      - @.cursor/rules/debug.mdc (Debugging notes)
