# User Experience Design

## Overview

This document outlines the user experience (UX) design approach for the Dutch Funding Opportunities platform. It details the design principles, user journeys, interface components, and interaction patterns that create an intuitive, accessible, and engaging experience for startup founders and investors navigating the Dutch funding landscape.

## UX Design Principles

### 1. Guided Journey

The platform employs a guided approach that leads users through the complex funding process with clear direction and contextual assistance.

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is presented in manageable chunks that gradually increase in complexity
- **Contextual Guidance**: Help and explanations appear at the moment they're needed
- **Clear Next Steps**: Users always know what actions to take next
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Show completion status and path forward

### 2. Personalized Experience

The experience adapts to each user's specific context, preferences, and history.

- **Tailored Content**: Recommendations and information relevant to user's startup profile
- **Adaptive Interface**: UI elements that adjust based on user's goals and progress
- **Remembered Preferences**: System recalls and applies user settings across sessions
- **Contextual Settings**: Options relevant to current activity are easily accessible

### 3. Reducing Cognitive Load

The interface minimizes mental effort required to navigate and use the platform.

- **Focused Screens**: Each view has a clear purpose with minimal distractions
- **Consistent Patterns**: Similar tasks use similar interaction patterns
- **Recognition Over Recall**: Visual cues help users recognize options rather than remember them
- **Chunking Information**: Complex processes are broken into logical steps

### 4. Trust and Transparency

The design builds user confidence through honest, clear communication.

- **Clear Expectations**: Users understand what will happen at each step
- **Transparent Processes**: Matching algorithms and recommendations include explanations
- **Visible System Status**: System provides feedback about current state and operations
- **Privacy Controls**: Users understand and control their data sharing

### 5. Accessibility and Inclusivity

The platform is designed to be usable by people with diverse abilities and needs.

- **WCAG Compliance**: Adherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 AA standards
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete functionality available without a mouse
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic markup and ARIA attributes for assistive technologies
- **Flexible Text Sizing**: Text scales without breaking layouts
- **Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios for text legibility
