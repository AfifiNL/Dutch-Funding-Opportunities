# Project Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the development and launch of the Dutch Funding Opportunities platform. The roadmap is organized into phases with clear milestones, deliverables, and timelines to guide the project execution and track progress.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Market Entry**: Establish the platform as a valuable resource for Dutch startups seeking funding
2. **User Adoption**: Achieve critical mass of users (both founders and investors)
3. **Platform Value**: Deliver measurable value in funding success rates
4. **Sustainable Operation**: Build a sustainable business model with clear revenue streams
5. **Ecosystem Impact**: Become an integral part of the Dutch startup ecosystem

## Phased Approach

The platform development follows a phased approach to manage complexity, validate assumptions, and deliver value incrementally:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)

Focus on establishing the core technical infrastructure and minimum viable product (MVP) features.

### Phase 2: Expansion (Months 4-6)

Enhance the platform with additional features based on initial user feedback and increase market penetration.

### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 7-9)

Refine the platform based on usage data, improve matching algorithms, and introduce advanced features.

### Phase 4: Scaling (Months 10-12)

Focus on growth, monetization strategies, and expansion of partnerships and integrations.
